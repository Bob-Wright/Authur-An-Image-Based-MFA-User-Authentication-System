The Authur system uses files from several folders. The main entry is the Portal.php program in the Storybook folder
and most of the registration and logon functions are contained within a number of subfolders within Storybook.

The PortalPGP folder represents a NodeJS API we use to handle our PGP based PKC encrypt and decrypt functions.

The Session2DB folder contains the database management code for our PHP SESSION management.
